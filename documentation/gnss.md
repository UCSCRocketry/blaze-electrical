# GNSS
GNSS provides absolute position, altitude, and velocity data to supplement other onboard sensors

The U-blox ZEDF9R GNSS module was chosen for its high accuracy and precision when operating in an RTK configuration.

GNSS data is processed and send through the common Blaze co-processor and CAN transceiver design described in the common documentation.
